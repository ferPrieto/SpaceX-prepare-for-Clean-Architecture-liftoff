<p align="center">
The purpose of this project is to consolidate some of the learned insights throughout the years about the <b>Clean Architecture</b> principles and reflect those lessons on Android, taking advantage of the Kotlin programming language features too.
<br/><br>This project summarises some of the general use cases and demands on a typical production project using: <b>Jetpack Compose</b>, <b>Functional Programming</b>,<b>MVVM</b>, <b>Kotlin Coroutines</b> and <b>Kotlin Flows</b> (check the branches section for more information).

## Libraries Used :books:
* [Compose][0] Toolkit for building native UI (in a declarative way - 100% Kotlin).
* [Coroutines][1] Library support for Kotlin coroutines.
* [Flows][2] Stream processing API, built on top of Coroutines.
* [Compose Navigation][3] for tabs navigation using Jetpack Compose.
* [Dagger Hilt][4] Dependency injection library for Android.
* [Retrofit][5] Type-safe REST client for Android to consume RESTful web services.
* [Timber][6] Logger with a small API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Espresso][7] Android UI Testing framework.
* [MockK][8] mocking framework for testing.
* [MockWebServer][9] A scriptable web server for testing HTTP clients, used for Instrumentation tests in this project.
* [Coil Compose][10] Image downloading and caching library supported by Jetpack Compose.
* [Lottie Compose][11] Library that provides that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile.
* [JodaTime][12] Date library that lets manage more extensively and easily dates
* [Shot][13] Shot is a Gradle plugin and a core android library thought to run screenshot tests for Android.

## Modules :bookmark_tabs:

<img src="/art/SpaceX-Demo.gif" align="right" width="32%"/>

* **app** - The application module with access to **all the application**
* **data** - Android module that **can only access domain module**
* **data-api** - Android module that **can only access data module**
* **domain** - Kotlin module that **cannot access any other module**

And two extra modules:
* **core** - Base classes module (factories, events, etc.) that **cannot access any other module**
* **core-android-test** - Tests classes module (rules, date builders,etc.) that **cannot access any other module**

## Branches :octocat:
There are three options depending on different tech-stack desired. The latest codebase will be updated in master.
These are the three options available (all of them maintained):

- [master][13]
  - Jetpack Compose (declarative UI)
  - Dagger Hilt
  - VM approach using UI States and Effects
  - Kotlin Flows (removed LiveData)
  - Modules simplification
  - The rest of modules remain the same (Tests)

- [SpaceX-Coroutines-Flows][14]
  - Imperative UI
  - Dagger2
  - Kotlin Coroutines and Flows
  - Granular modularisation (CleanArchitecture approach)
  - Unit Tests + UI Tests + MockWebServer + Robot Pattern

- [SpaceX-RxJava][15]
    - VMs and Fragments communication via RxJava
    - Dagger2
    - Granular modularisation (CleanArchitecture approach)
    - Unit Tests + UI Tests + MockWebServer + Robot Pattern

## Testing :mag:

### Unit Testing

There are some highlights:
* Every layer in the architecture has been tested.
* MockK has been used for mocking | stubbing.
* `Given | When | Then` code presentation order, in order to give a more structured style.
* Code Coverage (WORK IN PROGRESS).

### UI Testing (Compose)

I opted to use three types of approaches:
- MockWebserver, where real connection scenarios are setup. More information in my  [MockWebServer Medium Article][16]!
- `Tests in Isolation`, where it's possible to mock and set any content, UI state, etc. Which allows to emulate very specific edge cases.
- Screenshot Testing :camera_flash:

In the two first types of tests I used Robot Pattern to improve cleanliness and ease of readability. More information in my [RobotPattern Medium Article][17]!
